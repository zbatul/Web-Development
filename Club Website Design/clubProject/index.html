            <h2>What is Knitting?</h2>
            <p>Knitting is a method by which yarn is manipulated to create a textile or fabric. </p>
            <p>Knitting creates stitches or loops of yarn in a row. There may be a couple of active stitches on the knitting needle at one time. Knitted fabric consists of several consecutive rows of connected loops that intermesh with the next and previous rows. As each row is formed, each newly created loop is pulled through one or more loops from the prior row and placed on the gaining needle so that the loops from the prior row can be pulled off the other needle without unraveling. You can create infinite number of patterns with knitting. </p>
